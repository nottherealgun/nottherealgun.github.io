This consistency is crucial for maintaining readability and avoiding formatting issues when code is shared between team members or published online."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Additionally, some programming languages and style guides explicitly recommend spaces for indentation, suggesting a certain number of spaces (often two or four) per indentation level.

This adaptability can be particularly beneficial in teams with diverse preferences regarding code layout."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Tabs also have the advantage of semantic meaning.
